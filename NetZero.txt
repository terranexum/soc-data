Most modern industrial activities produce greenhouse gasses such as CO2 into the atmosphere. 
To acheive net-zero carbon emissions, corporations must reduce existing emissions, increase carbon reduction, or both.

CO2 capure in cement industry

The cement industry makes up 8% of global carbon emissions, making it the 6th largest producer of emissions behind transportation, energy, residential, industrial, and agricultural carbon emisisons. 

Recent technologies have allowed for over 90% of possible cement production emissions to be fixated within cement. This serves to reduce a producer's emissions and strengthen their product at a reduced cost. 

Portland concrete is a binding agent used in concrete.
It accounts for 10-12% of the material's total mass, but produces 90% of the cement emissions.

Of the 1370lbs of CO2 per tonne of cement, 400lbs come from just the tranportation of cement and required materials.
